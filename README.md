# Custom Head Traders

This is a datapack for Minecraft 1.13+ allows "Nitwit" villagers to trade for
player heads with custom textures. This will automatically convert Nitwits that spawn in the world naturally.

All player head textures used in this datapack from [minecraft-heads](https://minecraft-heads.com).

## Traders
* Chef - Trades for food.
* Craftsman - Trades for blocks.
* Gardener - Trades for plants.
* Lumberjack - Trades for logs.
* Huntsman - Trades for rare mob heads (ones that do not exist in vanilla).

## Feedback
Looking for feedback regarding pricing or textures for existing villagers and
ideas for new villagers and their trades.
